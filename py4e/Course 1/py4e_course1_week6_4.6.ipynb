Pay should be the normal rate for hours up to 40 and time-and-a-half for the hourly rate for all hours worked above 40 hours. Put the logic to do the computation of pay in a function called computepay() and use the function to do the computation. The function should return a value. Use 45 hours and a rate of 10.50 per hour to test the program (the pay should be 498.75). You should use input to read a string and float() to convert the string to a number. Do not worry about error checking the user input unless you want to - you can assume the user types numbers properly. Do not name your variable sum or use the sum() function."],"metadata":{"id":"43vH3nwDvg-e"}},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":4,"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"9Q9kf5KUvWh-","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1665453541612,"user_tz":0,"elapsed":30105,"user":{"displayName":"Joshua Nsiah Turkson","userId":"11483831368703477536"}},"outputId":"f716ebcb-c32a-4155-ea56-9d60ca547f0e"},"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["Enter Hours:45\n","Enter the rate: 10.5\n","Pay 498.75\n"]}],"source":["def computepay(h, r):\n","  if h<=40:\n","    Pay = 40*r\n","  else:\n","    Pay = 40*r+(h-40)*r*1.5\n","  return Pay\n","\n","hrs = float(input(\"Enter Hours:\"))\n","rate = float(input(\"Enter the rate: \"))\n","p = computepay(hrs, rate)\n","print(\"Pay\", p)"]}]}
